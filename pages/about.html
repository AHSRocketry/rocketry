            <h1>AHS Rocket Club</h1>
            <p>AHS Rocket Club meets to push the boundaries of our rocketeering beyond the time limits of ELW week. We meet weekly on Tuesdays between 3:30 and 5:00. We are working toward competing in the national ARC competition as well as our own personal projects. $50 tuition to join to allow for purchase of supplies.</p>
            <p>AHS Rocketry events (Club and ELW) are overseen by Alex DeBirk, teacher at American Heritage School. NAR #119453 & Tripoli #31401. Scheduled to receive Cert 1 (and possibly Cert 2) on April 5, 2025, and most certainly Cert 2 on May 17, 2025.</p>
            <h1>Frank Hunt Field</h1>
            <p>Frank Hunt Field (formerly Pony Express Test Range) is the name of the location that the Utah Rocket Club uses for its primary launch site. The range is huge, treeless, and really a great place to fly rockets. The elevation of the launch site is 5300 feet above sea level and is very susceptible to thermals. It is therefore a great location for duration contest events.</p>
            <p>Frank Hunt Field is a high desert environment. This means that the temperatures can vary from month to month, and even from hour to hour. Remember that during the day, the site can be very hot and at night, very cold. Always make sure to wear your sunscreen (recommend SPF 45) even when it is not hot and bring LOTS of WATER.</p>              
            <p>Frank Hunt Field is used with the permission of the US. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). UROC has a waiver in place at these launches from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that allows our members to fly high-powered rockets to altitudes as high as 10,000 ft AGL. Frank Hunt Field launch events are insured by the National Association of Rocketry and/or the Tripoli Rocketry Association.</p>
            <p>Unless you are there during a UROC event, there are no support facilities whatsoever (i.e. bathrooms).</p>
