    <p>For a rocket to be stable in flight, its center of mass (CM) <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> be forward of the center of pressure (CP). If not, then the rocket will tumble over during flight and become a dangerous missile.</p>
    <p>There is too much of a good thing here, though. If the CM is too far in front of the CP, then the rocket will be too sensitive, something referred to as being <em>weathercocked</em>. A weathercocked rocket will turn into any wind encountered during flight, reducing overall apogee and making the rocket more difficult to recover, not to mention making a potentially dangerous situation for the spectators.</p>
    <p>To ensure safety, <em>all</em> rockets must be designed such that the CM is 1.0 to 2.3 body tube diameters in front of the CP, something referred to as stability. At AHS, rockets are only approved if the stability is between 1.0 to 2.5. </p>
