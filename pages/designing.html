      OpenRocket is open source software used by rocketeers to design and test a model rocket before actually building and flying it. The software accurately computes the aerodynamic properties of rockets and simulates their flight, returning a wide range of technical results, ensuring that a rocket design is safe and viable.
    </p>
    $nbsp;
    <p>OpenRocket can be downloaded <a href="https://openrocket.info/downloads.html?vers=23.09" target="_blank">here</a></p>.
    $nbsp;
    <p>The program can be divided into two sections: <strong>Rocket Design</strong>where you design the model rocket, and <strong>Flight Simulation</strong>where you run simulations with a variety of motors to get an idea </p>
    <p>This page will teach you to design a basic rocket using OpenRocket. Read through the entire page or jump to various sections of the rocket by clicking picture of the coinciding rocket design below.
</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p>To be successful, each rocket <strong><em>must</em></strong> have the following elements. </p>
