        <h3>About Model Rockets</h3>
        <p>A model rocket is a small, powered replica designed for safe and controlled flight, typically used as a hobby or educational tool. Made from lightweight materials such as plastic, cardboard, or balsa wood, it is equipped with a solid rocket motor that generates thrust to propel it into the sky. Model rockets are guided by aerodynamic fins and often include a parachute or streamer for recovery after their flight.<Br><br>

        <h2>Flight of a model rocket</h2>
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="content-left">
                <p>The flight path of a model rocket begins with the <strong>powered flight phase</strong>, during which the rocket motor ignites and produces thrust to propel the rocket skyward. This phase is characterized by rapid acceleration as the motor's fuel burns, generating enough force to overcome gravity and air resistance. Once the motor's fuel is depleted, <strong>burnout</strong> occurs. At this point, the thrust ceases, but the rocket continues to ascend due to the momentum it gained during powered flight.</p>

                <p>Following burnout is the <strong>coasting phase</strong>, where the rocket climbs purely under its remaining kinetic energy. This phase ends at the <strong>apogee</strong>, the highest point of the rocket's flight path. At apogee, a <strong>recovery device</strong>, such as a parachute or streamer, is ejectedâ€”usually triggered by a small ejection charge in the rocket motor. The recovery device ensures a safe and controlled descent by slowing the rocket's fall, minimizing the risk of damage upon landing and making it easier to retrieve. This sequence creates a smooth and predictable flight path, which is a hallmark of safe and successful model rocket launches.</p>

        <h3>Motor Mounts</h3>
        <p>
            The motor mount is the special assembly at the bottom of the rocket that holds the motor. It has two essential functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the motor doesn't slide forward while firing or falling out during ejection charge.</li>
            <li>Center the motor inside the rocket body tube.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class ="content-container">
            <div class = "content-left">
                <p>The main components of a motor mount include the motor tube (1), centering rings (2), engine clip (3), and a motor block (4). The motor tube houses the rocket motor, while centering rings keep the mount aligned within the rocket body. An engine clip secures the motor in place, preventing it from being ejected during operation, and the thrust ring ensures the motor doesn't slide forward under the pressure of ignition. Larger rocket motors have a thrust ring on the bottom of the motor around the nozzle, making the motor block unnecessary.
