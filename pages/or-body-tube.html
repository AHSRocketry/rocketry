    <h2 class="content-header">Designing in OpenRocket</h2>
    <p>Body tubes are best designed in OpenRocket using built-in presets, as this will capture the proper outer and inner diameters, thickness, and material automatically. All that is left to do afterward is to adjust the length of the tube to achieve the proper centers of gravity and pressure for a good stability score. It is very important that the material of the body tube reflect reality as it is likely the largest piece of the rocket, and any incorrect materials will seriously compromise stability calculations. </p>
